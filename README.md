let's drop the text (PDF) in first, then look into how best to show that kind of content on Github

Will likely need to create a structure by which to flesh this out.

I don't think that the jupyter notebook format is the best, as this is too program specific. 
However combining all the code and snippets together may be equally problematic. 

can Github do the same?
